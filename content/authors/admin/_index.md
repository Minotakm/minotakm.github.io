I hold a PhD in computational physics from Trinity College Dublin, specializing in computational material science. My primary focus revolves around efficiently navigating the materials phase space using data analysis, machine learning, and materials informatics. I am currently applying these techniques in my PhD research to discover and design innovative materials within the realm of materials science. Passionate about the intersection of technology and material innovation.
